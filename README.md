## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**  
  - Pandas (Data Cleaning, EDA)  
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Interactive Analysis)  

---

## Dataset  
The dataset contains information about Netflix Movies & TV Shows, including:  
- Title  
- Director  
- Cast  
- Country  
- Date Added  
- Release Year  
- Rating  
- Duration  
- Type (Movie/TV Show)  
- Genre (listed in)

## Preprocessing & Data Cleaning  
**Steps performed:**  
1. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - Removed unnecessary duplicates  
   - Filled/replaced missing values in important columns  

2. **Dropping Incorrect Rows**  
   - Some rows in title had invalid values (e.g., `678, 2012, 23:59, Feb-09`) ‚Üí removed  
   - Some duplicate/invalid cast rows (e.g., `50 Cent, Ryan Phillippe, Bruce Willis...`) ‚Üí dropped  

3. **Splitting & Formatting Columns**  
   - Converted `date_added` to datetime format  
   - Extracted year, month, and day separately for analysis  
   - Cleaned duration (numeric minutes for Movies, seasons for TV Shows)
